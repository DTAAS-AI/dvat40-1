# ANU CVML Video Annotation Tool

The aim of this project is to develop a high-quality video annotation tool for computer vision and machine learning applications with the following desiradata:

1. Simple and efficient to use for a non-expert.
2. Supports multiple annotation types including temporal segments, object bounding boxes, sementic and instance regions, tracklets, and human pose (skeleton).
3. Runs in a browser without external libraries or need for server-side processing. But easy to plug-in a back-end for in-the-loop processing.
4. Integrates easily with crowd-sourced annotation services (e.g., Amazon Mechanical Turk).
5. Open-source.

Video tutorials will be posted on YouTube.
